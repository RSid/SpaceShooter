SpaceShooter
============

"Space Shooter" physics game written Processing. You play as an astronaut floating through space while trying to collect coins and avoid hostile aliens.
You have a gun to defend yourself with, but if you use it too freely something big and bad shows up. The in-game splashscreen will explain the controls.

It uses the jbox2d physics engine and Mick Grierson, Matthew Yee-King, and Marco Gillies's Maxim library.
All visuals and sounds either were made by me or come from Opengameart.org or Freesound.com. They are used under creative commons and their creators are cited in-code.
